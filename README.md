# Blockin-queue

I tried to implement the blocking queue in Java. Producer class is used to produce numbers and Consumer class for consuming the numbers in the queue.
Main is the driver class that has main() function which starts Producer and Consumer.

Problem:
Producer fills up queue with numbers, but consumer doesn't consume the numbers.
